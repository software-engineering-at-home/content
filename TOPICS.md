As content is written, edited, and produced - this index will grow to be filled out with links helping the audience find content.

## Channel Overview

Topics to do with the operation of the YouTube channel, including introductions, annoucements, updates, and the like.

- [Channel Introduction](./channel/000-Channel-Introduction.md)

## Agile Delivery Practices

Ways of working; processess and practices that would be considered agile, and how the delivery function supports product, business analysts, programmers, testers, and other roles in a large organisation - and how you can take on these roles at home in your own projects.

### Topics
- Scrum
- Kanban
- Make your queues visible
- Cumulative Flow Diagrams
- Cost of Delay
- Prioritisation
- Estimation
- Communication
- Retrospectives
- Shift left
- ...

## Architecture

Ways of assesssing, structuring, and designing software so that programs (no matter how large, or small) can be made simple, or simpler from chaotic, complex, or complicated forms.

- Architecture for programmers
- Drawing diagrams
- Event based systems
- Data lakes
- ...

## Computer Science

Where maths and electronics meet; computer science emerges; there are a huge number of relevant topics in computer science that can be applied to programming and software engineer.

- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- Memory
- Byte Code
- Simple Data vs Pointers
- JSON
- XML
- CPU Threads
- ...

## Organizational Structures 

Big and small organizations structure themselves in different ways to get the most out of their employees; its worth talking about different org structures and reflecting on how you might use that knowledge in the home environment with your family and community.

- The org chart
- Line of reporting
- Role of management in developing talent
- Matrix organisations
- Teams vs Specialists
- ...

## Programming

Coding is at the core of automation - to be able to take an idea, a process, and then automate it probably in large part requires writing code, or programming.

- JavaScript basics
- Callbacks, Promises, and Async await
- C++ basics
- .NET basics
- Java basics
- Java !== JavaScript
- Program structure
- Code architecture
- Object Orientated Programming
- Functional Programming
- Non-functional side effects
- Code that changes together should live together
- Deletability
- Coupling and cohesion
- JavaScript is a synchronous language
- Asynchronous applications using JavaScript
- Creating RESTFul APIs
- ...

## Software Delivery Lifecycle

The process of releasing value - from code to working software, integrating real world user feedback, and improving the value proposition of our code base while managing technical debt.

- There is an infinite amount of value to be created
- Continuous Integration
- Build pipelines
- Source Control
- Your code as a crime scene
- Pull Requests
- Code Reviews
- Code as a product
- Long term maintenance
- Load testing
- Non-functional requirements
- ...

## Team Building

How to you negotiate to bring together a group of people under a combined goal? What distractions to people face? Team building is an important aspect of supporting and maintaining large software systems. 

- Vision and Goals
- Quarterly objectives and key results (OKRs)
- Strategy vs Tactics
- Camaraderie / Comradery
- Team Branding
- Psychological Safety
- Fun things
- Team health
- Roles and responsibilities
- ...

## Software Testing

Validating that software is correct is large and complex field; the more time you spend on it, the more issues you can find - but writing automated tests can crystalize a project and make it hard to change. 

- Why test?
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Schema tests
- Contract testing
- API testing
- Smoke tests
- Test Driven Development
- Behaviour Driven Development
- TDD and BDD the same thing?
- When to manually test
- When to automate testing
- ...

## Service Design

Next level software development is about services; products are built and sold, but services are timely and ongoing. We now have the knowledge and ability to build autoamted systems that respond to events and change across time. How does service based design influence how we build and design software?

- Products vs Services
- Good Services
- Supporting services with software
- Separating software tools from the services they provide
- Service Catalogues
- Measuring the success of a service
- ...

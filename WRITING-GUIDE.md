## Intro

Consistent, interesting, and digestable information. This structured writing guide will help you produce content; it can be used as an ordered checklist, and as a scoring mechanism to generate high quality content.

---

## First Steps

To get started, make sure your idea has a place in the [TOPICS.md](TOPICS.md) index - all that's needed is a title on a new line; find the right specialism to group it under - make a new specialism if breaking new ground. This is a great stage to save, commit, and push the change up to the public repo.

Next, when you're ready, make a markdown file from [WRITING-TEMPLATE.md](WRITING-TEMPLATE.md); don't worry about filling the details at this stage.

Finally, link to your new markdown file from [TOPICS.md](TOPICS.md) to show that you're working on it.

## Intro

Hi and welcome to the Software Engineering at Home channel. My name is John and I'm a trained Software Engineer who's worked for the past 20 years either as a programmer, developer, or software engineer. I'm passionate about the field of Software Engineering; both from a hobbiest and professional perspective. I think engineering is a great mindset to have and there are lots of topics I'd like to explore through this channel.

Through my career so far I've had chance to work as a programmer, software team lead, delivery manager, and people manager. I've worked across the English speaking world for British, Australian and American companies, and have developed a sense for how big and small organisations work.

Over time I'll be growing the channel with new topics- many of which have been scoped out already as part of the planning for this channel.

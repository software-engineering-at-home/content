class: intro

## So you want to be an expert?

When joining a team; it is rarely made explicit what skills and knowledge your colleagues have. People do brief introductions about their time at a company, their previous experience, and their current focus. These introductions set the scene for who your colleagues might be, but very rarely do people get into the grit of what people actually know.

Additionally, it is hard to guage how experienced people are across a range of tasks. An engineer who's been working for 20 years might not know about basic linux networking commands such as `dig` because they've been working on windows machines, or might have no understanding of how the .NET interpreter works in comparison to a JVM because they've been working in C++, Rust, and Go.

The 5 stage learning model presented in this topic provides a transparent framework for scoring knowledge consistently across a team, allowing a team lead to quickly identify skill gaps, and provide a practical training plan for the team.

## 5 Stage Model of Learning

The 5 stage model is very simply:

1. Awareness
2. Research
3. Usage
4. Practiced
5. Teaching

The model is designed to be easy to grade using a series of yes/no questions, whilst implying exponential knowledge and experience to advance upwards along the scale.

By producing a simple number multiple skills can be quickly graded and stored in a spreadsheet or training plan.

## How experienced are you?

With the model in mind; the basic question becomes: "How experienced are you with X?" where "X" is the skill being graded. 

Some examples:
- How experienced are you with cooking?
- How experienced are you with baking bread?
- How experiecned are you with swimming?
- How experienced are you with C++?
- How experienced are you with painting?
- How experienced are you with oil painting on silk canvas?

Not all skills are equal, general skills tend to be a lot more common, although the results and quality will differ. You might be able to teach someone to cook a passable meal, but have never tried to bake bread, even though baking bread requires many of the basic cooking skills. I can teach a child to paint using brushes and water colours, but I've never used oil paints on a silk canvas.

## Awareness

Awareness means you at least have a word or concept with which to link any further knowledge to.

At this first level of the model, the basic yes-no question to ask is; "Have you heard of the thing?".

Perhaps you have asked someone about the thing, looked it up in a dictionary, or encyclopedia, or more likely, you found a definition online. Once you have a word to associate with - you can go find out what the thing is!

We're all born without knowledge; it's ok to be unaware of things. The great news is upon hearing a new word - you get to learn about a new thing! 

Not being aware of a concept is something of a *Pandora's Box* - technically on this model, you score 0 if you're unaware of a thing, but as soon as you can map out the word in your mind, you have then become aware of the concept, even if you've done no further research on the topic, which is enough to score you a 1 on the Learning by Numbers scale for this skill.

## Research

Research means you have spent time and effort to learn about the concept in question.

At the second level of the model, the basic yes-no question to ask is; "Have you researched the thing?".

Perhaps you've read a book on the topic, or watched a youtube video? Maybe you've read a scientific paper, listened to a podcast, read an indepth news article, cribbed notes from a textbook, found a README file in github, or had a teacher explain the concept to you.

If you have researched the thing, then you know what the thing is, so you should have some experience of the theory behind the thing; you would score at least 2 on the Learning by Numbers scale for this skill.

???

## Usage

Usage means you've at least taken your theoretical understanding of a thing, and acted it out in the world.

At this third level of the model, the basic yes-no question to ask is; "Have you used the thing?".

Perhaps you've atended a cooking class, or a wood working workshop. Maybe you've rendered a 3D scene from your home computer, or compiled a computer program. Maybe you've made a spreadsheet, played an instrument, walked up a hill. The important thing is that you've got hands on personal experience with the thing, changing it from a purely theoretical concept to something that you have practical experience with.

If you have used the thing, you have practical experience and memories of how to achieve that thing again the future. You probably feel pretty confident about the thing! You would score at least 3 on the Learning by Numbers scale for this skill.

## Practiced

Practiced means you have achieve a level of skill beyond basic usage.

At this fourth level of the model, the basic yes-no question to ask is; "Have you extensively used the thing?".

Perhaps you have toiled away at a thing, practicing, failing, perfecting your skill. Maybe you've experimented with flavour, colour, tone, going so far as to write your own memoirs on the topic.

If you have used the thing extensively, then you should be able to trust yourself and your second nature to do those things again without second thought. You would score at least 4 on the Learning by Numbers scale for this skill.

## Teaching

Teaching means you've passed on your knowledge of the skill to someone else. 

At this fith level of the model, the basic yes-no question to ask is; "Have you taught the thing to someone else?".

Perhaps you're a mentor at work, or school, or in a community group. Maybe you're a team leader. Maybe you've built a YouTube channel, published a udemy course, or shared your knowledge with the world via a podcast.

If you have taught the thing to someone else, and answered yes to all the other questions, then you are probably as good as an expert. On the Learning by Numbers scale you would score 5 for this skill. That's not to say you know everything about the topic, or have more to learn - there are people who spend years, if not decades perfecting their craft. Potentially there's a scale for 6's, 7's, and 8's - such people might have PhDs, be business owners, or are recognised nationally and internationally.
